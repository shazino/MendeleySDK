# MendeleySDK
**Objective-C client for the Mendeley Open API (deprecated).**
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shazino/MendeleySDK.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shazino/MendeleySDK)

**:warning: IMPORTANT: MendeleySDK was designed for the original Mendeley “Open API”. It has now been deprecated, and developers should migrate to the new Mendeley API. This MendeleySDK will _NOT_ be updated, so you should switch to the new official Objective-C kit: [MendeleyKit](https://github.com/Mendeley/mendeleykit).**


MendeleySDK is a [Mendeley API](http://apidocs.mendeley.com) client for iOS and OS X,
 built on top of [AFNetworking](http://www.github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)
 and [AFOAuth2Client](http://www.github.com/AFNetworking/AFOAuth2Client).

## Getting Started

### Installation

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add MendeleySDK to your project.

Here’s an example podfile that installs MendeleySDK and its dependency, AFOAuth2Client. 

```ruby
platform :ios, '5.0'

pod 'MendeleySDK', '1.5'
```

### App credentials

Configure the shared API client by calling `configureSharedClientWithClientID:secret:redirectURI:` with your application consumer key, secret, and redirect URI (in your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`, for instance):

```objective-c
[MDLMendeleyAPIClient configureSharedClientWithClientID:@"###my_consumer_key###"
                                                 secret:@"###my_consumer_secret###"
                                            redirectURI:@"###mdl-custom-scheme://oauth?###"];
```

If you don’t have a consumer key and secret, go to the [Mendeley Developers Portal](https://sites.google.com/site/mendeleyapi/home/authentication) and register your application first.

**Note: if you already had an application for OAuth 1.0, you’ll need to register a new application for OAuth 2.0.**

### OAuth authorization flow

Once the API client is configured, you need to present a web browser with a `authenticationWebURL` request. This page will make sure that your application is properly recognized, and prompt the user for his credentials. You can either use an in-app `UIWebView`, or open Safari and catch the response with a custom URL scheme. 

After being logged in, you’ll get an authorization code. You can then validate this code in order to obtain the access and refresh tokens with `validateOAuthCode:success:failure:`.

As of today, MendeleySDK doesn’t support the client credentials flow for public resources.

Okay, you should be ready to go now! You can also take a look at the demo apps and see how things work.

## Examples

### How to create a new document

```objective-c
[MDLDocument createNewDocumentWithTitle:@"title" success:^(MDLDocument *document) {
     /* ... */
} failure:^(NSError *error) {
    /* ... */
}];
```

### How to upload a file

```objective-c
MDLDocument *document;
[document uploadFileAtURL:localFileURL success:^() {
    /* ... */
} failure:^(NSError *error) {
    /* ... */
}];
```
